## Overview of the analysis:
surfs_up analysis is based on a business plan analysis, in-terms of investment, favorable weather conditions, investors, business success probability of a Surf and Shake shop, serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. We partners with W. Avy, who is famous for his love fo surfing and we will properly analyze data and run some analytics on a weather data set W. Avy has from the very island where we would like to open our first shop. 

For this analysis W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
